    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the test.ipynb notebook in the data directory, the test set we use is full of out of domain images. We would like to discard as many of them as possible. In order to do that we will use an object detector and further processing to create our own landmark classifier. \n",

    "We will use YOLO (You Only Look Once) pre trained model as an object detctor. YOLO is a state of the art object detctor that achived great results on various data sets. We used [darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet) implemntation which allow to use pre-trained models easily. "

Open Images dataset is a big, diverse data set with Open Images  ~9M images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, visual relationships, and localized narratives. We used it's detection part that contain 15,851,536 boxes on 600 categories. The bounding box annotation made by people and not by computers and therefore are higly accurate.  "
